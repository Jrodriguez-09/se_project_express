# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. This application tracks the weather based on the user's location and helps them decide what to wear based on the weather. Building this app was to help us understand how to deploy web applications, work with multiple databases, setting up authorizations and testing. 

## Running the Project
`npm run start` — to launch the server 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Technologies Used
Node.js/Express.js - web application
MongoDB - used for the database
Postman/Github Actions - used for testing

#### Testing
Sprint 12 and 13.
